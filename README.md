# sudoku_solver
A python sudoku solver with out the use of backtracking. 
While backtracking using recursive functions would have been an easier solution.
I wrote this code in a way that represents how I would logically solve a Sudoku if it was in the paper. Using the method of having possible guesses for each cell until there is only one option left.
